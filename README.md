About the app

SpotFly is web application who is created to help a junior paragliding pilot, but not only, 
to find suitable place for their first fligt without instructor to guide them. 
In this application you can find information about where is the launch and landing zone, coordinates, 
description, difficulty level of the place, wing direction for launch.

As a pilot with not much experience I never knew whether a place was suitable ot nor, what its a 
characteristics to the place, what wind direction is suitable for launch. So I decide 
to develop this application and of course it's one of my biggest project at the moment in the 
field of web development. In addition to information about the place, you can also vote about difficulty 
level on place according to your experience and leave your comment.

I guess the app can save a lot of time for new pilots who looking for suitable lacations for theit solo
flights.
